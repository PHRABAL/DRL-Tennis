# DRL - MADDPG Algorithm - Tennis Collaboration/Competition

## Overview
Using the Unity agent/environment "Tennis", this deep reinforcement learning task trains two AI agents to play tennis with each other in a cooperative way. The agents receive positive rewards for getting the ball over the net and negative rewards for missing or hitting the ball out of bounds. The task is considered solved when the average reward of the winning agent each episode hits 0.5 over 100 consecutive episodes.
